    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Switching Multifractal Model (from here on we call it MSM) is a stochastic volatility model used in finance based on an assumption that the **return volatility is a multifractal system**. This assumption **captures various stylized facts of financial market** such as fat tails, scaling (more detailed explanation in the next chapter), volatility clustering and long memory. Due to this nature, MSM has gained popularity among finance researchers and is widely applied to model volatile assets such as commodity and foreign exchange futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the specification, MSM can either have finite or infinite number of states. Calvet et al (2004) considered the finite case and employed maximum likelihood estimation to estimate parameters of this model by taking into account all possible paths from first order Markov chain and picked the set of parameters with the highest likelihood. This approach is **computaionally expensive and will be infeasible quickly** when the number of states are increased to enhance its predictive capability. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we instead considered applying **particle filter to approximate the likelihood and simulate predictions**. This procedure allows us to **handle the high dimensional settings of the MSM efficiently**.Then, we compared the performance with the original model and the GARCH model which is a more common stochastic volatility model."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we implemented and modified Binomial MSM introduced in Calve et al (2004). MSM is based on a model called Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (MMAR) introduced by Mandelbrot et al (1997) which tries to connect the area of fractal geometry to finance. However, due to its nonstationarity and complex combinatorial nature, MMAR did not gain wide recognition. MSM improves upon this by reconstructing MMAR into a state space model (or hidden Markov model for statisticians) which already has a significant foothold in financial research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its multifractal construction allows to model long term dependece of returns in various degrees of frequencies. This is a phenomenon known as scaling in finance which states that volatility in different frequencies (from seconds to all the way up to years) have some connections with each other. Moreover, it will naturally model sudden discontinous jump in volatility which is often hard to model in many mainstream stochastc volatility models even though we can find many examples of such occurances. For exmaple, a generic GARCH model cannot handle such situation and therefore GARH-Jump model was invented with the cost of introducing another parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will use Binomial MSM to model highly volatily assests and compare its performance to GARCH which is more widely used model for estimation and foercasting of stochastic volatility."

    "# Description of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MSM is often denoted as $MSM(\\bar k)$ where $\\bar k$ is a model parameter (so we don't estimate it) which represents the number of multipliers $M_{i,t}\\ \\ i = 1,...,\\bar k$. Then, We define $M_t$ as a vector of these multipliers at time $t$ which is treated as a state at $t$. In equation it is shown as below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, each components of $M_t$ have the same marginal distribution $M(\\theta)$ but differes in the switching frequency which is given by exogenous parameters $\\gamma \\equiv (\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2,...,\\gamma_{\\bar k})$. Therefore the dynamics of multipliers are specified as following\n",

    "    \\begin{cases}\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to this construction, multipliers are mutually independent with each other and the stochastic volatility can be considered as a function of the vector $M_t$ with first-order Markov property.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "which is just a realization of the state $\\sigma(M_t)$ with the Gaussian error.Thus,the full parameter vector is $\\psi \\equiv (b, \\theta,\\gamma_{1},\\bar \\sigma)$. For the marginal distribution $M(\\theta)$, any distribution with positive support will do the job as long as $\\mathbb{E}(m) = 1$.\n",

    "Essentially, MSM$(\\bar k)$ is a hidden markov model with $\\bar k$ components and if we use the simplest specification of $M(\\theta)$ where $m$ only takes two values with equal probability, the transition matrix of the state $M_t$ is $2^{\\bar k}*2^{\\bar k}$. For this project, we will use this specification and specify $\\theta = m_0$ as in the Calver et al (2004) where $M(m_0)$ is a binomial distribution which yields either $m_0$ or $m_1 = 1-m_0$ with equal probability (thus we can specify the parameter of this distribution with $m_0$).\n",

    "# Description of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we describe author's (Calvet et al) algorithm (written in Matlab) and our direct python implementation of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Matlab code and our direct implementation will do the estimation of $MSM(\\bar k)$ once the user provides the number of multipliers $\\bar k$ and the data and returns the estimated value of parameters $\\psi \\equiv (b,m_0,\\gamma_{\\bar k},\\bar \\sigma,)$   (for some reason, they used $\\gamma_{\\bar k}$ instead of $\\gamma_1$, anyway by picking one of the value of $\\gamma_k$ and $b$, all other $\\gamma$'s will be fully specified). To implement this, the author created two files (and for our implementation two modules plus another module for prediction). We will briefly describe the functionality of these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting value search\n",
    "\n",
    "Our starting_val module is a python translation of author's starting value serch code. Essentially, it finds appropriate starting values of parameters $\\psi$ to be used in the MLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we gave parameters except $m_0$ several candidate values. Then we run scipy.optimize.fminbound() and maximized the data likelihood with respect to $m_0$ bounded between 1.2 and 1.8 for all combination of other parameters (so we do a grid search).\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is the set of parameters $\\psi$ with the maximum likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Likelihood function\n",
    "\n",
    "In our likelihood module, we implemented the likelihood function serving in three ways: starting value search, MLE and state estimation. For this reason, it returns different set of variables depending on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "When our input for the set of parameters is not a vector (so the user didn't specify the starting values for the parameters), it will only return the likelihood since in this case the function is used for starting value search.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the starting value search, we have access to an appropriate set of starting values to supply to the function minimizer. Then we use the likelihood function again still limiting the number of output to only the full data likelihood and try global minimum serch with scipy.optimize.basinhopping(). Both our algorithm and the original Matlab code will occasionally fail to get the global minimum and can get stuck in the local minimum depending on the complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation of the exact likelihood goes like this.First we define the conditional probability of $M_t$ being at one of its $2^{\\bar k}$ states given the return at time t as \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",

Since the original transition matrix creation required two functions to do this (T_mat_template() and transition_mat()) we made it simpler by using np.fromfunc() to create the transition matrix. This lead to a significant improvement in the computation speed even when $\\bar k$ is relatively big which is why we chose this function to be used in our final model.\n",

    "As shown above, The expectation $E[F(M_{t+1})|R_{t+1}]$ can be approximated with the weighted average of the statistics of drawn samples, weighted by the likelihoods of the returns. This resembles the form of approximation using importance sampling. Since, $F$ function was defined as a mapping from the real number space to the positive real value space, $F$ can be replaced with the state conditional probability $\\Pi_{t+1}$. Therefore, the proof demonstrates that the code implementation of our particle filtering can be justfied to approximate $\\Pi_{t+1}$ with re-sampled $\\{\\hat{M}_{t+1}^{(i)}  \\}_{i=1}^B$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure of particle filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "At fixed time $t$,  \n",
    "i) Draw $\\{M_{t+1}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$ using $P(M_{t+1}^{i}|M_{t}^{i})$  (one row of a ransition Matrix A).  \n",
    "ii) Reweight the probability of draws using importance sampling and re-draw $\\{\\hat{M}_{t+1}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$ using those reweighted probabilities.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $\\{M_{t}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$ have been independently drawn from $\\Pi_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Pi_{t+1}$ can be updated given a new return $r_{t+1}$ as follows.  \n",
    "$\\Pi_{t+1}^j \\propto f_{r_{t+1}}(r_{t+1}|M_{t+1}=m^j)\\sum_{i=1}^d P(M_{t+1}=m^j|M_t=m^i)\\Pi_t^i$  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, draw $M_{t+1}^{(i)}$ given $M_{t}^{(i)}$ using one-step ahead Marcov chain property of $M_t$ Repeat this B times, then first stage of $\\{M_{t+1}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$ are obtained. Then by taking the weighted average of states, we have a filtered estimate of $M_{t+1}$ using the information up to time $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once we have the observation at time $t+1$, we can update $M_{t+1}$ incorporating the information of the return at $t+1$ in the following step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fixed sample $b$, calculate $P(q=b) = \\frac{f_{r_{t+1}}(r_{t+1}|M_{t+1}=M_{t+1}^{(b)})}{\\sum_{a=1}^B f_{r_{t+1}}(r_{t+1}|M_{t+1} = M_{t+1}^{(a)})}$.  \n",
    "Then draw B samples of $M_{t+1}$ from $\\{M_{t}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$ with corresponding weighted probabilities and let them be defined as $\\{\\hat{M}_{t+1}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{B}$. Then it will follow conditional distribution $\\Pi_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecasting using the particle filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $\\{M_{T}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$ is sampled correctly using the method above.\n",
    "\n",
    "At fixed time $T$,  \n",
    "i) Draw $\\{M_{T+1}^{(b)}\\}_{b=1}^B$ using $P(M_{T+1}^{(b)}|M_{T}= M_{T}^{(b)})$.   \n",
    "ii) Calculate the probability of draws using importance sampling and obtain $\\tilde{M}_{T+1}$ using those probabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, draw $M_{T+1}^{(b)}$ using one-step forward Marcov chain property of $M_t$. After repeating this sampling for $\\forall b$, we are able to obtain temporary samples of $\\{\\hat{M}_{T+1}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^B$. \n",
    "In the second stage of sampling, we calculate the weight $P(q=b) = \\frac{f_{r_{T}}(r_{T}|M_{t+1}=M_{T+1}^{(b)})}{\\sum_{a=1}^B f_{r_{T}}(r_{T}|M_{T+1} = M_{T+1}^{(a)})}$ for $\\forall b$. Unlike particle filtering for sampling $M_t$ up to t=T where the likelihoods of one period forward returns are used to calculate the weights of each sample,  we are using the likelihood of the return at current time $t=T$ because we do not have $r_{T+1}$ at $t=T$. Finally, the weighted average $\\tilde{M}_{T+1} = \\sum_{b=1}^B p(q=b)\\hat{M}_{T+1}^{(b)}$ can be obtained with samples' corresponding probabilities.  \n",
    "Since the likelihood of the return at $t=T+1$ is determined by $M_{T+1}$, predicting the stochastic volatility index $M_{T+1}$ is equivalent to implementing a prediction on the return $r_{T+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of particle filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as we can see from the step one of the procedure part, we only need to have a single row of the transition matrix which corresponds to the probability of moving to $2^{\\bar k}$ states given current state of the sample. Therefore, the computational complexity of the procedure is linear to $2^{\\bar k}$ while the exact computation requires full transition matrix which has a computational complexity squared of $2^{\\bar k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since a lot of samples are correlated when $\\bar k$ is large, we will only sample from the subset of rows.Coupled with the use of Memoization which we implemented by defining the memoization class and added a decorator to the function, this process will only compute those subset of rows once, and from the next time when a sample is taken from that state, will just use the transition probabilities stored in the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the step one for both procedure is order invariant. Therefore, we can paralellize this computationally expensive part. For this reason, we implemented multhreading with multiprocessing ThreadPool() function. The reason why we implemented multithreading instead of multiprocessing is because the latter will run in the different memory space, thus Memoization will be done in each space which will diminish the effectiveness of it because a previously computed result in another process is  inaccessible by other processes and thus will recompute the value again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally for any n-step ahead forecasting, particle filter will reuse the samples at the previous time and give it a new state depending on the transition probability and continue this procedure up until it reaches the n-th step. The original approach on the other hand must compute 1st,2nd,...nth power of the transition matrix and apply to the current posterior distribution $\\Pi_t$ which is much more expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of the particle filter approach to the exact calculation of the posterior\n",
    "\n",
    "For computational efficiency, the transition_prob() function has a memoize decorator which will store the output of a previously received inputs in the memory to avoid recalculation. This lead to a significant improvement in the computation time of particle filters."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we optimized the estimation of MSM by improving the code and then introduced particle filter for likelihood approximation, state estimation by filtring and n-step ahead forecasting. Then we optimized the particle filter using methods such as multiprocessing and memoization so that it can be more efficient compared with the exact calculation of posterior quantities and prediction employed in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results from simulated and real data presented above colloborates the claim that particle filter is more efficient in high dimensional setting although the concern about the decrease in accuracy may not have been fully addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the MSM is built in the context of finance, its construction is more general which only assumes that the process it's tracking is a multifractal system with normal observation noise. Therefore, it may be used in other areas of science as well. Considering that the Mandelbrot who inverted MMAR which lead to the creation of MSM has applied his work concerning fractals in wide variety of areas from math,physics to computer graphics etc this model may have wider audience as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we must acknowledge the limitation of our algorithm which sometimes will get stuck in local minimum and does not return optimal parameter values. However, this was also the case for the author's Matlab code (although fmincon() function used for optimization in their code seems to work much better than our basinhopping L-BFGS-B minimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the introduction of particle filters was not just aimed for an increase in filtering and forecasting performance but was also intended to aid parameter estimation. If we can use particle filter instad of MLE to get a parameter estimate, it will speed up the process even more. This is because particle filtering is done sequentially (which is why it's also called sequential monte carlo) and thus whenever a new observation is obtained at time $t$, the update can be just done with the data and the prior (which is a posterior at time $t-1$) whereas MLE must use all the data up to $t$ to recalculate the parameter estimate (or set a window length). However, the parameter estimation with particle filter is a frontier in the area of statistics and considering the time constraints we were unable to implement that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our future aim is to implement some sort of self organizing state space model (proposed by Kitagawa(1998)) to change evey part of MSM process into the context of filtering so that it can become an online learning algorithm which allows sequential updates."
